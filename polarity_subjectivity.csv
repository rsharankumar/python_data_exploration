Secondly not understanding that with the new legislation super accounts (not pension accounts) will be the main withdrawl method for living expenses. Withdrawal processes in super need to be updated for regular payments etc. Currently there is only a costly lump sum withdrawal process.

3102,"Don't feel special, you are all as bad as each other. The only saving grace is that many of the problems are possibly due to poor government legislation. I certainly hope so, otherwise you are worse than I think. My specific problem relates to the fact that we ""must have"" a super account even when undertaking casual employment, particularly for short periods of time. So the miniscule amount of money is rapidly eaten away by ""management"" fees, $1.50 per day in your case. That is about $550 over 12 months. Most of us working a seasonal harvest would not make that much! There needs to be a special category super account for casual seasonal workers which is more like a bank account. The money goes in, it is less than the prescribed minimum, I am over retirement age, so I can withdraw the lot (before you do). There are no charges, you get to use the money whilst you have it, then I get at least the contributions back. Then it is there for next year. Saves you money too because at the moment, I close the account, then open a new one next year and you have to go through all the expense of setting up a new account, sending out paperwork, etc, etc, etc. Try thinking outside the square!

Then both my sons accounts had insurance premiums taken out although we had specified no insurance was required. Then I was told that its a legal requirement for insurance on balances coming from another employer, which I don't believe and insurance with Aus Super wont be valid until the account balance is over 10,000 dollars anyway. Both my sons accounts are below 2000 dollars so Aus Super will be taking insurance premiums for years for no reason! We can cancel the insurance but the premiums are already taken out, disgraceful.

I know the government has 26 week wait which I have argued with human services branch, because its ludicrous and due to it have had to access super early twice now and I still haven't paid original debt which could have been paid off in 2015 and I wouldn't have had to go on centrelink benefits at all. I know it was legislation but still gets me very angry as its cost me thousands of dollars in lost employment, has lead to me having a disgraced credit rating, has lead to my name and business being put through court and legal action, and has lead to health problems through stress and having no money to pay for living expenses, you name it. Not to mention having centre link involvement. I never wanted to go on centre link, not to mention having to give up work over a 26 week period as it had to be continuos and you couldn't earn over a certain amount, just to get your super so you can get straight back to business, which was the only purpose I asked for it in the first place. I find centre link and their system a joke, and as far as I am concerned they shouldn't be involved what so ever and are frustrated that due to other people declaring bankruptcy my business and life has turned to a disaster. I think that if you could show and demonstrate why the money should be accessed early with documentation, the super fund should be able to grant the money. Now I have been on centre link for more than 2 years and have paid thousands of dollars in interest and legal fees etc, which I explained in 2015 and knew was going to happen and wasted I don't know how much time which could have been resolved quickly and easily if the super was granted in early 2015",5.0,0.11,0.44
